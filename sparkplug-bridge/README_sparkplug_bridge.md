# Pre-requisites Installation
For compiling sparkplug-bridge container sources on machine without container, following pre-requisites needs to installed on machine,
1. Install make and cmake
2. Install wget by using command "sudo apt-get install wget".
3. Install Git by using command "sudo apt install git"
4. Install all the EII libraries on host by running the shell script -- `sudo -E ./eii_libs_installer.sh`. Refer the README.md from  `IEdgeInsights\common\README.md` for details.
5. Install log4cpp (version - 1.1.3, link - https://sourceforge.net/projects/log4cpp/files/latest/download/log4cpp-1.1.3.tar.gz) library under /usr/local/ directory.
6. Install yaml-cpp (branch - yaml-cpp-0.6.3, version - 0.6.3, link - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
7. Install paho-cpp (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
8. Install eclipse-tahu (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/tahu) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
9. Install ssl (https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1g.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
10. Install uwc_common library refering to `README_UWC_Common.md` of `uwc_common` folder and copy `uwc_common/uwc_util/lib/libuwc-common.so` and `uwc_common/uwc_util/include/all .hpp files` in `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\lib ` and `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\include` directory respectively.
	
# Steps to compile sparkplug-bridge 
1. Go to `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\Release directory` and open a terminal.
2. Execute ``$make clean all`` command
3. After successfull execution of step 3, application executable must be generated in current directory (i.e. Release).

Notes : Above instructions are specified to build the sources in "Release" mode. To build sources in "Debug" mode, please execute the same steps in "Debug" folder inside `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\` folder. 

# Steps to run sparkplug-bridge executable on machine
1. Deploy ia_etcd container with dev mode using following steps. 
	1. Run `01_uwc_pre_requisites.sh` script as explained in the main uwc/README.md.
	2. Run the provisioning command script to deploy ia_etcd container as explainedin main uwc/README.md.
2. Go to `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\Release` directory and open bash terminal.
3. Set EII specific environment variables using below command.
	`source <Complete Path of .env file present inside IEdgeInsights/build directory>`
	For example `source /home/intel/uwc-releases/IEdgeInsights/build/.env`
4. Export all other environment variables required for sparkplug-bridge container. Refer environment section from sparkplug-bridge service present inside docker-compose.yml file of sparkplug-bridge service (E.g. `export AppName="SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE"` for exporting AppName variable likewise all other variables needed to be exported in the same terminal) 
5. After successful compilation, run the application binary with following command,
	`./SPARKPLUGBRIDGE`
	
# Steps to deploy sources inside container
Kindly Refer UWC user guide for container deployments 

# Steps to run unit test cases 
1. Pre-requisites Installation for unit test execution
	1. Install latest version of "gcovr" tool for coverage report generation by using command "pip install gcovr".
	2. Install gtest (wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
	3. All other Pre-requisites to be installed mentioned in section # Pre-requisites Installation
2. Follow same steps mentioned in section # Steps to compile sparkplug-bridge, step 1 to step 3, but in "Build.test" directory of `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE` instead of "Release" directory.
3. Run unit test cases
	1. Go to `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\Build.test` directory and open bash terminal.
	2. Export all environment variables required for sparkplug-bridge-test container. Refer environment section from sparkplug-bridge-test service present inside docker-compose_unit_test.yml file (E.g. `export AppName="SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE"` for exporting AppName variable likewise all other variables needed to be exported in the same terminal) 
	3. After successful compilation, run the application binary with following command,
	`./SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE-TEST > SPARKPLUGBRIDGE_status.log`
	4. After successful execution of step 4, unit test log file `SPARKPLUGBRIDGE_status.log` must be generated in the same folder that is Build.test
4. Generate unit test coverage report
	1. Go to `Sourcecode\sparkplug-bridge\SPARKPLUG-BRIDGE\Build.test` directory and		 open bash terminal.
	2. Run the command,
		`gcovr --html -e "../Test" -e "../include/utils" -e "../include/tahu" -e "../include/yaml-cpp" -e "../src/utils" -e "../include/log4cpp/Appender.hh" -e "../include/ConfigManager.hpp" -e "../include/EnvironmentVarHandler.hpp" -e "../include/Logger.hpp" -e "../include/NetworkInfo.hpp" --exclude-throw-branches -o SPARKPLUGBRIDGE_Report.html -r .. .`
	3. After successful execution of step 2, unit test coverage report file `SPARKPLUGBRIDGE_Report.html` must be generated.
5. Run unit test cases inside container
	1. Kindly follow the steps mentioned in section `## Steps to run unit test cases` of file `README.md` in Sourcecode directory.

Notes : When unit test is executed locally (not inside container), two test cases fail and coverage is 10% less. This is because cert files paths which are mentioned in constructor of class CSCADAHandler in SCADAHandler.cpp are un-traceable.
