# Global YML configurations
# UWC performs majorly 4 operations - polling, on-demand-write, on-demand-read, SparkPlug_Operation
# Based on realtime requirement, these operations are further classified into following sub-operations
#	1. polling realtime
#	2. polling non-realtime
#	3. on-demand read realtime
#	4. on-demand read non-realtime
#	5. on-demand write realtime
#	6. on-demand write non-realtime
#
# This file contains configuration to be used for these operations across UWC containers (e.g. TCP1, RTU1, MQTT-Export, scada-rtu, etc.).
# Following fields are defined in this for all 3 major operations:
# 	default_realtime: 
#		values: true or false
#		It defines how an operation should be performed in absence of corresponding realtime indicator.
#		E.g. in case of on-demand-write or read request, the json payload contains a field called "realtime".
# 		which tells whether the request is of realtime nature or not. 
#		This field defines realtime nature in absence of such a field in on-demand request or polling configuration.
#	realtime: 
#		This is a group field, say operation_subtype, explained below.
#	non-realtime: 
#		This is a group field, say operation_subtype, explained below.
#
#	operation_subtype:
#		This is a group field. It defines configuration parameters for sub-operations i.e. realtime and non-realtime.
#		It contains following fields.
#		operation_priority: 
#			values: 1 to 6
#			The field defines priority to be assigned to 6 sub-operations, listed above.
#			1 is lowest priority and 6 is highest priority. 
#			Hence, if there are 2 requests ready for execution, a request with higher priority will be executed first.
#		retries: 
#			values: 0 to 4
#			This field specifies if a request of particular type should be resent if a response is not received
#			within specified limit. Value 0 means no retry is needed. value 1 means, retry once.
#		qos: 
#			values: 0, 1, 2
#			MQTT-Export will use this QoS value while publishing a message on MQTT.
#
# If incorrect value is specified for any of above fields, a default value (listed below) will be used:
#	default_realtime: false
#	operation_priority: 1
#	retries: 0
#	qos: 0
#
# If incorrect values are specified for Sparkplug opearation, a default values (listed below) will be used:
#       group_id: "UWC Nodes"
#        edge_node_id:
#              nodeName: "SCADA RTU"
#              generateUniqueName: true
#
#  SparkPlug_Operation:
#     group_id: It defines value to be used for “group_id” element in the Sparkplug™ Topic Namespace.
#     interface_name: The interface name on which edge node communicates with SCADA-MQTT. E.g. “eth0”
#     edge_node_id: This is a group field. It defines configuration for forming the value of “edge_node_id” element in the Sparkplug™ Topic Namespace.
#                   Following is the algorithm for forming the value:
#                   [value in “nodeName” field] + “-” + [MAC id of interface provided in “interface_name” field].
#     nodeName: It defines value to be used as a part of “edge_node_id” element in the Sparkplug™ Topic Namespace. 
#     generateUniqueName: It defines whether a unique name shall be generated for “edge_node_id” using the algorithm.          

# If MAC of given interface is not found, then “00” is used.
# If configuration parameter or section is missing for any of the sub-operation, then default values mentioned above will be used.
# default_scale_factor. 
#  It defines scale factor default value. Default value is always 1.0
