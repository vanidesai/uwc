# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or 
# QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
# Set to 0 to disable the publishing of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# Time in seconds between cleaning the internal message store of 
# unreferenced messages. Lower values will result in lower memory 
# usage but more processor time, higher values will have the 
# opposite effect.
# Setting a value of 0 means the unreferenced messages will be 
# disposed of as quickly as possible.
#store_clean_interval 10

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means 
# a pid file shouldn't be written.
# This should be set to /var/run/mosquitto.pid if mosquitto is
# being run automatically on boot with an init script and 
# start-stop-daemon or similar.
#pid_file

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary 
# group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should 
# be started by the user you wish it to run as.
#user mosquitto

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per 
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and 
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no 
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1 
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 20

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue 
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 100. Set 
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
# See also queue_qos0_messages.
#max_queued_messages 100

# Set to true to queue messages with QoS 0 when a persistent client is
# disconnected. These messages are included in the limit imposed by
# max_queued_messages.
# Defaults to false.
# This is a non-standard option for the MQTT v3.1 spec but is allowed in
# v3.1.1.
#queue_qos0_messages false

# This option sets the maximum publish payload size that the broker will allow.
# Received messages that exceed this size will not be accepted by the broker.
# The default value is 0, which means that all valid MQTT messages are
# accepted. MQTT imposes a maximum payload size of 268435455 bytes. 
message_size_limit 10000000

# This option controls whether a client is allowed to connect with a zero
# length client id or not. This option only affects clients using MQTT v3.1.1
# and later. If set to false, clients connecting with a zero length client id
# are disconnected. If set to true, clients will be allocated a client id by
# the broker. This means it is only useful for clients with clean session set
# to true.
#allow_zero_length_clientid true

# If allow_zero_length_clientid is true, this option allows you to set a prefix
# to automatically generated client ids to aid visibility in logs.
#auto_id_prefix

# This option allows persistent clients (those with clean session set to false)
# to be removed if they do not reconnect within a certain time frame.
#
# This is a non-standard option in MQTT V3.1 but allowed in MQTT v3.1.1.
#
# Badly designed clients may set clean session to false whilst using a randomly
# generated client id. This leads to persistent clients that will never
# reconnect. This option allows these clients to be removed.
#
# The expiration period should be an integer followed by one of h d w m y for
# hour, day, week, month and year respectively. For example
#
persistent_client_expiration 3h
# persistent_client_expiration 14d
# persistent_client_expiration 1y
#
# The default if not set is to never expire persistent clients.
#persistent_client_expiration

# If a client is subscribed to multiple subscriptions that overlap, e.g. foo/#
# and foo/+/baz , then MQTT expects that when the broker receives a message on
# a topic that matches both subscriptions, such as foo/bar/baz, then the client
# should only receive the message once.
# Mosquitto keeps track of which clients a message has been sent to in order to
# meet this requirement. The allow_duplicate_messages option allows this
# behaviour to be disabled, which may be useful if you have a large number of
# clients subscribed to the same set of topics and are very concerned about
# minimising memory usage.
# It can be safely set to true if you know in advance that your clients will
# never have overlapping subscriptions, otherwise your clients must be able to
# correctly deal with duplicate messages even when then have QoS=2.
#allow_duplicate_messages false

# The MQTT specification requires that the QoS of a message delivered to a
# subscriber is never upgraded to match the QoS of the subscription. Enabling
# this option changes this behaviour. If upgrade_outgoing_qos is set true,
# messages sent to a subscriber will always match the QoS of its subscription.
# This is a non-standard option explicitly disallowed by the spec.
#upgrade_outgoing_qos false

# =================================================================
# Default listener
# =================================================================

# IP address/hostname to bind the default listener to. If not
# given, the default listener will not be bound to a specific 
# address and so will be accessible to all network interfaces.
# bind_address ip-address/host name
#bind_address localhost

# Port to use for the default listener.
port 11883

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is 
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections 
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of 
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# Choose the protocol to use when listening.
# This can be either mqtt or websockets.
# Websockets support is currently disabled by default at compile time.
# Certificate based TLS may be used with websockets, except that
# only the cafile, certfile, keyfile and ciphers options are supported.
#protocol mqtt

# When a listener is using the websockets protocol, it is possible to serve
# http data as well. Set http_dir to a directory which contains the files you
# wish to serve. If this option is not specified, then no normal http
# connections will be possible.
#http_dir

# Set use_username_as_clientid to true to replace the clientid that a client
# connected with with its username. This allows authentication to be tied to
# the clientid, which means that it is possible to prevent one client
# disconnecting another by using the same clientid.
# If a client connects with no username it will be disconnected as not
# authorised when this option is set to true.
# Do not use in conjunction with clientid_prefixes.
# See also use_identity_as_username.
#use_username_as_clientid

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options can be used to enable SSL/TLS support for 
# this listener. Note that the recommended port for MQTT over TLS
# is 8883, but this must be set manually.
#
# See also the mosquitto-tls man page.

# At least one of cafile or capath must be defined. They both 
# define methods of accessing the PEM encoded Certificate 
# Authority certificates that have signed your server certificate 
# and that you wish to trust.
# cafile defines the path to a file containing the CA certificates.
# capath defines a directory that will be searched for files
# containing the CA certificates. For capath to work correctly, the
# certificate files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run
# "c_rehash <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.
#cafile /run/secrets/ca_broker
#capath

# Path to the PEM encoded server certificate.
#certfile /run/secrets/broker_cert

# Path to the PEM encoded keyfile.
#keyfile /run/secrets/broker_key

# This option defines the version of the TLS protocol to use for this listener.
# The default value allows v1.2, v1.1 and v1.0, if they are all supported by
# the version of openssl that the broker was compiled against. For openssl >=
# 1.0.1 the valid values are tlsv1.2 tlsv1.1 and tlsv1. For openssl < 1.0.1 the
# valid values are tlsv1.
#tls_version tlsv1.2

# By default a TLS enabled listener will operate in a similar fashion to a
# https enabled web server, in that the server has a certificate signed by a CA
# and the client will verify that it is a trusted certificate. The overall aim
# is encryption of the network traffic. By setting require_certificate to true,
# the client must provide a valid certificate in order for the network
# connection to proceed. This allows access to the broker to be controlled
# outside of the mechanisms provided by MQTT.
require_certificate false

# If require_certificate is true, you may set use_identity_as_username to true
# to use the CN value from the client certificate as a username. If this is
# true, the password_file option will not be used for this listener.
use_identity_as_username false

# If you have require_certificate set to true, you can create a certificate
# revocation list file to revoke access to particular client certificates. If
# you have done this, use crlfile to point to the PEM encoded revocation file.
#crlfile

# If you wish to control which encryption ciphers are used, use the ciphers
# option. The list of available ciphers can be optained using the "openssl
# ciphers" command and should be provided in the same format as the output of
# that command.
# If unset defaults to DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT:!SSLv2:@STRENGTH
#ciphers DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT:!SSLv2:@STRENGTH

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-shared-key based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options can be used to enable PSK based SSL/TLS support for
# this listener. Note that the recommended port for MQTT over TLS is 8883, but
# this must be set manually.
#
# See also the mosquitto-tls man page and the "Certificate based SSL/TLS
# support" section. Only one of certificate or PSK encryption support can be
# enabled for any listener.

# The psk_hint option enables pre-shared-key support for this listener and also
# acts as an identifier for this listener. The hint is sent to clients and may
# be used locally to aid authentication. The hint is a free form string that
# doesn't have much meaning in itself, so feel free to be creative.
# If this option is provided, see psk_file to define the pre-shared keys to be
# used or create a security plugin to handle them.
#psk_hint

# Set use_identity_as_username to have the psk identity sent by the client used
# as its username. Authentication will be carried out using the PSK rather than
# the MQTT username/password and so password_file will not be used for this
# listener.
#use_identity_as_username false

# When using PSK, the encryption ciphers used will be chosen from the list of
# available PSK ciphers. If you want to control which ciphers are available,
# use the "ciphers" option.  The list of available ciphers can be optained
# using the "openssl ciphers" command and should be provided in the same format
# as the output of that command.

# =================================================================
# Extra listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable 
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If 
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given, 
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip 
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In 
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that 
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and 
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
# listener port-number [ip address/host name]
#listener localhost

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is 
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections 
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of 
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# The listener can be restricted to operating within a topic hierarchy using
# the mount_point option. This is achieved be prefixing the mount_point string
# to all topics for any clients connected to this listener. This prefixing only
# happens internally to the broker; the client will not see the prefix.
#mount_point

# Choose the protocol to use when listening.
# This can be either mqtt or websockets.

# autosave_interval then the in-memory database will be saved to disk.
# If false, mosquitto will save the in-memory database to disk by treating
# autosave_interval as a time in seconds.

# =================================================================
# Logging
# =================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple 
# logging destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic file
#
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
#
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up 
# in /var/log/messages or similar.
#
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>', 
# where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I, M which are debug, error, 
# warning, notice, information and message. Message type severity is used by
# the subscribe/unsubscribe log_types and publishes log messages to
# $SYS/broker/log/M/susbcribe or $SYS/broker/log/M/unsubscribe.
#
# The file destination requires an additional parameter which is the file to be
# logged to, e.g. "log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto.log". The file will be
# closed and reopened when the broker receives a HUP signal. Only a single file
# destination may be configured.
#
# Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to
# "log_dest none" and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
log_dest syslog
log_dest stdout

# If using syslog logging (not on Windows), messages will be logged to the
# "daemon" facility by default. Use the log_facility option to choose which of
# local0 to local7 to log to instead. The option value should be an integer
# value, e.g. "log_facility 5" to use local5.
#log_facility

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, 
# none, subscribe, unsubscribe, websockets, all.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming/outgoing
# network packets. They are not logged in "topics".
#log_type all
log_type error
