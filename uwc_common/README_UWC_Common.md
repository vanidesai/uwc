3. `Dockerfile.common.test` - Dockerfile to install all the dependencies and libraries needed by all the unit test containers
4. `Dockerfile_UT` - Dockerfile to build unit test container for uwc-common sources testing.

# Pre-requisites Installation
For compiling uwc-common container sources on machine without container, following pre-requisites needs to installed on machine,
1. Install make and cmake
2. Install wget by using command "sudo apt-get install wget".
3. Install Git by using command "sudo apt install git"
4. Install all the EII libraries on host from `EdgeInsightsSoftware-v2.2-PV\IEdgeInsights\common\libs` directory. (Refer EII README files to do the same)
5. Install log4cpp (version - 1.1.3, link - https://sourceforge.net/projects/log4cpp/files/latest/download/log4cpp-1.1.3.tar.gz) library under /usr/local/ directory.
6. Install yaml-cpp (branch - yaml-cpp-0.6.3, version - 0.6.3, link - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
7. Install paho-cpp (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
8. Install eclipse-tahu (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/tahu) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
9. Install ssl (https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1g.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
	
# Steps to compile uwc-common
1. Compile uwc_common with following steps,
	1. Copy all the Pre-requisite library files in /usr/local/lib/ and all the Pre-requisite header files in /usr/local/include directory.
	1. Go to `Sourcecode\uwc_common\uwc_util\Release` directory and open a bash terminal.
	2. Execute `$make clean all` command.
	3. After successful completion of step 2, libuwc-common.so library must be created in same directory.

Notes : Above instructions are specified to build the sources in "Release" mode. To build sources in "Debug" mode, please execute the same steps in "Debug" folder inside `Sourcecode\uwc_common\uwc_util\` folder. 

# Steps to run uwc-common library on machine
Since it is not an executable, it cannot be executed
	
# Steps to deploy sources inside container
Kindly Refer UWC user guide for container deployments 

# Steps to run unit test cases 
1. Pre-requisites Installation for unit test execution
	1. Install latest version of "gcovr" tool for coverage report generation by using command "pip install gcovr".
	2. Install gtest (wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
	3. All other Pre-requisites to be installed mentioned in section # Pre-requisites Installation
2. Follow same steps mentioned in section # Steps to compile uwc-common, but in "Build.test" directory of `Sourcecode\uwc_common\uwc_util` instead of `Release` directory.
3. Run unit test cases
	1. Deploy ia_etcd container with dev mode using following steps. 
		1. Run `01_pre-requisites.sh --isTLS=no  --brokerAddr="mqtt_test_container" --brokerPort="11883" --qos=1 --deployMode=IPC_DEV` script
		2. Add `network_mode: host` option in two containers present in EdgeInsightsSoftware-v2.2-PV\IEdgeInsights\docker_setup\provision\dep\docker-compose-provision.yml file.
		3. Run `02_provisionEII.sh` script to deploy ia_etcd container
	2. Go to `Sourcecode\uwc_common\uwc_util\Build.test` directory and open bash terminal.
	3. Export all environment variables required for uwc-util-test container. Refer environment section from uwc-util-test service present inside docker-compose_unit_test.yml file (E.g. `export AppName="UWCUTIL"` for exporting AppName variable likewise all other variables needed to be exported in the same terminal) 
	4. After successful compilation, run the application binary with following command,
	`./uwc-common > /reports/uwc-util/UWCUTIL_status.log`
	5. After successful execution of step 4, unit test log file `UWCUTIL_status.log` must be generated in the same folder that is Build.test
4. Generate unit test coverage report
	1. Go to `Sourcecode/uwc_common/uwc_util/Build.test` directory and open bash terminal.
	2. Run the command,
		`gcovr --html -e "../Test/" -e "../include/log4cpp/Appender.hh" -exclude-throw-branches -o UWCUTIL_Report.html -r .. .`
	3. After successful execution of step 2, unit test coverage report file `UWCUTIL_Report.html` must be generated.
5. Run unit test cases inside container
	1. Kindly follow the steps mentioned in section `## Steps to run unit test cases` of file `README.md` in Sourcecode directory.
