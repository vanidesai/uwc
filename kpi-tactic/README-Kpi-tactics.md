1. Install make and cmake
2. Install wget by using command "sudo apt-get install wget".
3. Install Git by using command "sudo apt install git"
4. Install all the EII libraries on host by running the shell script -- `sudo -E ./eii_libs_installer.sh`. Refre the README.md from  `IEdgeInsights\common\README.md` for details.
5. Install log4cpp (version - 1.1.3, link - https://sourceforge.net/projects/log4cpp/files/latest/download/log4cpp-1.1.3.tar.gz) library under /usr/local/ directory.
6. Install yaml-cpp (branch - yaml-cpp-0.6.3, version - 0.6.3, link - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
7. Install paho-cpp (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
8. Install eclipse-tahu (branch develop https://github.com/eclipse/tahu) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
9. Install ssl (https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1g.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
10. Install uwc_common library refering to `README_UWC_Common.md` of `uwc_common` and copy `uwc_common/uwc_util/lib/libuwc-common.so` and 'uwc_common/uwc_util/include' (.hpp) in `Sourcecode\kpi-tactic\KPIApp\lib` and `Sourcecode/kpi-tactic/KPIApp/include` directory respectively.

# Steps to compile Kpi-tactic

1. Go to `Sourcecode/kpi-tactic/KPIApp/Release` directory and open a terminal.
2. Execute `$make clean all` command.
3. After successful execution of step 2, application executable must be generated in current directory (i.e. Release).

Notes : Above instructions are specified to build the sources in "Release" mode. To build sources in "Debug" mode, please execute the same steps in "Debug" folder inside `Sourcecode\kpi-tactic\` folder.

# Steps to run kpi executable on machine
1. Deploy ia_etcd container with dev mode using following steps. 
	1. Run `preReq.sh` script as explained in the main uwc/README.md.
	2. Add `network_mode: host` option in two containers present in IEdgeInsights\build\provision\dep\docker-compose-provision.yml file.
	3. Run th eprovisioning command script to deploy ia_etcd container as explainedin main uwc/README/md.
2. Go to `Sourcecode/kpi-tactic/KPIApp/Release` directory and open bash terminal.
3. Set EII specific environment variables using below command.
	`source <Complete Path of .env file present inside IEdgeInsights/build directory>`
	For example `source /home/intel/IEdgeInsights/build/.env`
4. Export all environment variables required for Kpi container. Refer environment section from kpi-tactic's docker-compose.yml file (E.g. `export AppName="KPIAPP"` for exporting AppName variable likewise all other variables needed to be exported in the same terminal).
5. After successful compilation, run the application binary with following command,
	`./KPIApp-test`

# Steps to deploy sources inside container
Kindly Refer UWC user guide for container deployments

# Steps to run unit test cases
1. Pre-requisites Installation for unit test execution
    1. Install latest version of "gcovr" tool for coverage report generation by using command "pip install gcovr".
    2. Install gtest (wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz) libraries on host under /usr/local/ directory.
    3. All other Pre-requisites to be installed mentioned in section # Pre-requisites Installation
2. Follow same steps mentioned in section # Steps to compile Kpi-tactic , step 1 to step 3, but in "Build.test" directory of `Sourcecode/kpi-tactic/KPIApp` instead of "release" directory.
3. Run unit test cases
    1. Deploy ia_etcd container with dev mode using following steps. 
        1. Run `01_pre-requisites.sh --isTLS=no  --brokerAddr="mqtt_test_container" --brokerPort="11883" --qos=1 --deployMode=IPC_DEV` script
        2. Add `network_mode: host` option in two containers present in EdgeInsightsSoftware-v2.2-PV\IEdgeInsights\docker_setup\provision\dep\docker-compose-provision.yml file. 
        3. Run `02_provision_UWC_.sh` script to deploy ia_etcd container
    2. Go to `Sourcecode\kpi-tactic\KPIApp\Build.test` directory and open bash terminal.
    3. Export all environment variables required for KPIApp container. Refer environment section from kpi-tactic service present inside docker-compose_unit_test.yml file (E.g. `export AppName="KPIAPP"` for exporting AppName variable likewise all other variables needed to be exported in the same terminal) 
    4. After successful compilation, run the application binary with following command,
    `./KPIApp > kpi_tactics_status.log` 
    5. After successful execution of step 4, unit test log file `kpi_tactics_status.log` must be generated in the same folder that is Build.test
4. Generate unit test coverage report
    1. Go to `Sourcecode/kpi-tactic/KPIApp/Build.test` directory and open bash terminal.
    2. Run the command,
        `gcovr --html -e "../Test" -e "../include/ZmqHandler.hpp" -e "../include/Logger.hpp" -e "../include/EnvironmentVarHandler.hpp" -e ../../bin --exclude-throw-branches -o KPI_reoport.html -r .. .`
    3. After successful execution of step 2, unit test coverage report file `KPI_reoport.html` must be generated.

 
Notes : Above steps are to run KPIApp unit test locally. In order to run unit test in container, please follow the steps mentioned in section `## Steps to run unit test cases` of file `README.md` in Sourcecode directory.
